# Spatial LibriSpeech

Spatial LibriSpeech, is a spatial audio dataset with over 650 hours of first-order
ambisonics, and optional distractor noise (with raw 19-channel audio coming soon). Spatial LibriSpeech is designed  for machine learning
model training, and it includes labels for source position, speaking direction, room acoustics and
geometry. Spatial LibriSpeech was generated by augmenting LibriSpeech samples with 200k+ simulated
acoustic conditions across 8k+ synthetic rooms.

## üìú License

By downloading and using Spatial LibriSpeech, you are agreeing to comply with
the terms of its [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## üíæ Download
Our downloader script & pytorch dataloader will be uploaded soon.

### Manual download
In the meantime, all our files are hosted here:
```python3
SLS_URI = "https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/ml-research/datasets/spatial-librispeech/v1"
```
You can manually download the metadata from here. Refer to [dataset schema](DATASET_SCHEMA.md)
for more information about how the data is structured.
```python3
f"{SLS_URI}/metadata.parquet"
```
Using the metadata you can manually download samples with:
```python3
# speech first order ambisonics samples
f"{SLS_URI}/ambisonics/{sample_id:06}.flac"
# distractor noise first order ambisonics samples
f"{SLS_URI}/noise_ambisonics/{sample_id:06}.flac"
```

So, for instance, you may download the metadata with this command:
```bash
curl -O https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/ml-research/datasets/spatial-librispeech/v1/metadata.parquet
```
And the first speech sample with:
```bash
curl -O https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/ml-research/datasets/spatial-librispeech/v1/ambisonics/000000.flac
```

‚ö†Ô∏è 19-channel speech and distractor noise samples are very large and we are evaluating how to best host them. If
you need them in the meantime, please contact us.
